# About Me
Hey! Im Kal! Im between 10 and 16 and have strange interests for my age. I am learning to code along with other stuff to make some of my projects happen
# My Interests

And More
# My Projects
My main projects are:
(Hidden for now because I am not progressing well and want to take my time)
### Notes:
Most projects will be hosted at [@Kalphalus](https://www.github.com/Kalphalus) from now on


Im avoiding AI Code apps because I wont be able to do basic things without if I go with them.


My Profiles "Contributions" arent really contributions, im bad at this, so I can update the same thing like 15-20 times in 5 minites


I wouldnt be here without [@SourceLocation](https://www.github.com/sourcelocation) and [@LeminLimez](https://www.github.com/LeminLimez), if I hadnt found TrollTools it wouldnt have brought me down the path of coding, if either of you are reading this, thank you.
