# About Me
Hey! Im Kal! Im between 10 and 16 and have strange interests for my age. I am learning to code along with other stuff to make some of my projects happen
# My Interests
Im interested in:
Coding
3D Modeling/Animation
Music Creation/Production
Soldering/Repairs
And More
# My Projects
My main projects are:
YouRTube (YouTube Client to watch videos your way)
PlaiR (Music Player meant to be the best pick)
Sondera (A Chat app like discord, this is the least likely to take off in my opinion)
### Notes:
Im avoiding AI Code apps because I wont be able to do basic things without if I go with them.


I wouldnt be here without [SourceLocation](https://www.github.com/sourcelocation) and [LeminLimez](https://www.github.com/LeminLimez), if I hadnt found TrollTools it wouldnt have brought me down the path of coding, if either of you are reading this, thank you.
